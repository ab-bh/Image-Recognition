## Week 2: Logistic Regression Approach as Neural Network for cat Image recognition
### Dataset:
 > **Training**: 13 samples <br>
 > **Testing** : 24 samples
### Results:
 > **Testing Accuracy**: 67% (model trained on just 13 samples and tested on 24 samples!) <br>
 Contains Week2 Assignment with **utils.py** created by me :smile: <br>
 
 ## Week 3: Shallow Neural Network
 > Built a 2 layer Neural Network from scratch <br>
 > Complete implementation of **Forwardprop**, **Backprop**, **Loss evaluation** and **Parameter updation**. <br>
 > A **90%** accuracy model built. <br>
